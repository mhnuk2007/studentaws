# StudentAWS Project

A **Full-Stack Student Management Application** deployed on **AWS** using multiple approaches:
- **EC2 + RDS**
- **Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) + RDS**
- **(Coming Soon) ECS + RDS**

---

## ✅ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- **Deployment:** EC2, EBS, (ECS Next)
- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 on EC2 instances

---

## 🌐 Live URL
Deployed on EC2:  
`http://184.72.211.180/`

---

## ⚙ Features
- Add, view, update, and delete student records.
- Frontend integrated with backend APIs.
- PostgreSQL database hosted on **AWS RDS**.
- Environment-specific configurations.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Approaches

### 1️⃣ EC2 + RDS
- **Frontend**: Built React app and served using Nginx on EC2.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot JAR deployed on EC2 instance.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL RDS instance connected via security groups.

**Steps:**
1. Launch EC2 instance (Ubuntu).
2. Install Java, Node.js, and Nginx.
3. Build backend: `mvn clean package` → `target/studentapp.jar`.
4. Deploy JAR: `java -jar studentapp.jar`.
5. Build frontend: `npm run build` → serve `dist/` with Nginx.
6. Configure security groups for ports 80 (HTTP) and 8080 (Backend).

---

### 2️⃣ Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) + RDS
- Packaged backend as a WAR/JAR and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Configured environment variables for RDS connection.
- Connected EBS environment to PostgreSQL RDS.

**Steps:**
1. Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment (Java Platform).
2. Upload Spring Boot JAR via AWS Management Console.
3. Configure RDS endpoint in application properties.

---

### 3️⃣ (Coming Soon) ECS + RDS
- Dockerize both **Frontend** and **Backend**.
- Push images to **Amazon ECR**.
- Create ECS Fargate cluster with tasks for backend and frontend.
- Connect services via Application Load Balancer.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Used **AWS Security Groups** for IP whitelisting.
- Stored DB credentials in environment variables (not in code).
- Enabled HTTPS for production via Nginx reverse proxy (future step).

---

## 🛠 How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd studentaws
   ```
2. Backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Deployment on ECS + RDS.
- Add HTTPS and domain integration with Route 53 & ACM.
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

---

## 🖼 Architecture Diagram (Planned)
[Will include EC2, EBS, ECS deployment flow]
